Microdosimetry Extension
========================

The current version of the TOPAS microdosimetry extension includes scorers to retrieve microdosimetric spectra from primary and secondary particles. The extension is  available on the TOPAS GitHub_ page. The included examples show how to score RBE with a biological weighting function or with the microdosimetric kinetic model (MKM). Two geometries of tissue equivalent proportional counter (TEPC) are provided. The extension was validated in the following reference.
