Welcome to the TOPAS documentation!
=======================================

The TOPAS_ toolkit aims to provide an intuitive Monte Carlo framework for medical physicists and researchers in related fields. TOPAS is based on the `Geant4 Simulation Toolkit`_ and offers specific extensions for application in Radiation Oncology. The text-based TOPAS parameter control system allows users to create their own Monte Carlo simulations using a large library of components and examples built by the TOPAS developers and its users, including particle sources, geometry components, scorers, outcome models, time features, etc. TOPAS provides immense flexibility to design your own simulation without writing C++ code.

In addition, TOPAS offers an extension mechanism that requires only minimal C++ coding for advanced users who want to add new functionalities. Extension classes have access to all of the features of TOPAS and Geant4. Since version 4.0, TOPAS has been released as OpenTOPAS and is based on Geant4.11. 

To discover the Geant4 version used by a specific version of TOPAS, please consult the :ref:`version` section.
