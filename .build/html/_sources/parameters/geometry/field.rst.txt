Electromagnetic Fields
----------------------

You can assign an electric, magnetic or combined electromagnetic field to any geometry component (with exception of Group components, which have no intrinsic extent). The field will extend into any child components unless they themselves have their own field.

To assign a field, add the parameter ``Field``, as in::

    s:Ge/MyComponent/Field = "DipoleMagnet" # "DipoleMagnet", "QuadrupoleMagnet", "MappedMagnet", "UniformElectroMagnetic" or your own definition

For ``"DipoleMagnet"``, specify dipole field and strength (see :ref:`example_special_dipole`)::

    u:Ge/MyComponent/MagneticFieldDirectionX = 0.0
    u:Ge/MyComponent/MagneticFieldDirectionY = 1.0
    u:Ge/MyComponent/MagneticFieldDirectionZ = 0.0
    d:Ge/MyComponent/MagneticFieldStrength = 3.0 tesla

For ``"QuadrupoleMagnet"``, specify the two components of the gradient (see :ref:`example_special_quadrupole`)::

    d:Ge/MyComponent/MagneticFieldGradientX = 1.0 tesla
    d:Ge/MyComponent/MagneticFieldGradientY = 1.0 tesla

For ``"MappedMagnet"``, specify a field map in the Opera 3D format (see :ref:`example_special_purgingmagnet`)::

    s:Ge/MyComponent/MagneticField3DTable = "PurgMag3D.TABLE"

For ``"UniformElectroMagnetic"``, specify electric field and dipole magnetic field (see :ref:`example_special_electromagnet`)::

    u:Ge/MyComponent/ElectricFieldDirectionX = 1.0
    u:Ge/MyComponent/ElectricFieldDirectionY = 1.0
    u:Ge/MyComponent/ElectricFieldDirectionZ = 0.0
    d:Ge/MyComponent/ElectricFieldStrength   = 5000 kV/cm
    u:Ge/MyComponent/MagneticFieldDirectionX = 0.0
    u:Ge/MyComponent/MagneticFieldDirectionY = 1.0
    u:Ge/MyComponent/MagneticFieldDirectionZ = 0.0
    d:Ge/MyComponent/MagneticFieldStrength   = 5.0 tesla

If you have any other value in ``Field``, TOPAS will look in your extensions to find your own class that defines this field. See :ref:`extension_fields` for details on writing extension fields.

Field orientation is set by rotating the component.

You can visualize magnetic fields, with field intensity and direction depicted through a set of arrows::

    i:Gr/ViewA/MagneticFieldArrowDensity = 10

.. warning::

    Use ``MagneticFieldArrowDensity`` with caution. When combined with rotation it seems to sometimes cause crashes in polycone drawing (involved in drawing the arrowheads).

As with almost any TOPAS parameter, the Electric Field Strength, Dipole Magnet Strength, Quadrupole Magnet Gradient or Mapped Magnetic Field file can be set to change over time by using :ref:`time_feature` such as (see :ref:`example_special_quadanddipole`)::

    d:Ge/MyComponent/MagneticFieldStrength = Tf/BField1st/Value tesla

Fine control of the stepping algorithm can be done by changing the following parameters from their default values::

    s:Ge/MyComponent/FieldStepper = "ClassicalRK4"
    d:Ge/MyComponent/FieldStepMinimum = 1.0 mm
    d:Ge/MyComponent/FieldDeltaChord = 1.0e-1 mm

See the Geant4 Application Developers Guide on the `Geant4 Documention Page  <https://geant4.web.cern.ch/support/user_documentation>`_ for detailed discussion of these options.
