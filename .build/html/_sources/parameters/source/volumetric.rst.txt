.. _source_volumetric:

Volumetric Source
-----------------

The Volumetric source emit particles from randomly sampled starting positions from within the radioactive volume of a given component.

This source type has been designed for Brachytherapy applications (though there may be other applications as well).

Specify source type as::

    s:So/MySource/Type = "Volumetric"

And then add an additional required parameter::

    s:So/MySource/ActiveMaterial

to specify which material within the given component should be considered radioactive.

So, for example, if you have::

    s:So/MySource/Type            = "Volumetric"
    s:So/MySource/Component       = "ActiveSource"
    sc:So/MySource/ActiveMaterial = "G4_Ir"

particles will start from randomly sampled positions within the Iridium parts of the component named ``ActiveSource``.

Examples that use this source can be found in:

* :ref:`example_brachytherapy`
* :ref:`example_VolumetricSource`

The energies and species of the emitted particles can be specified using the same parameters available to the :ref:`source_beam`.
