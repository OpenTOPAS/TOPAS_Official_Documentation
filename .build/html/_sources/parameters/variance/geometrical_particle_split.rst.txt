Geometrical Particle Splitting
------------------------------

TOPAS variance reduction is further described in:

Ramos-Mendez et al, “Geometrical splitting technique to improve the computational efficiency in Monte Carlo calculations for proton therapy,” Med. Phys. `40, 041718 (2013)`_

This technique was designed for heavy charged particles. In this implementation, you must specify whether the beam entering into the sub-component has cylindrical symmetry or not. This is because the particles may or may not be randomly redistributed around the ``SplitAxis``.

The Russian roulette is applied in a particular direction. That is, at the split plane and prior to being split, the particle is subject to the Russian roulette if its direction does not point towards a Region of Interest (ROI). Then the radius of the ROI and its position on the ``SplitAxis`` must to be defined too. Further, the Russian roulette can be turned on/off at specific surfaces between sub-components.

.. code::

    s:Vr/ParticleSplit/Type = "GeometricalParticleSplit"
    s:Vr/ParticleSplit/SplitAxis = "zaxis"
    d:Vr/ParticleSplit/RussianRoulette/ROIRadius = 7.8 cm
    d:Vr/ParticleSplit/RussianRoulette/ROITrans = 10 cm
    bv:Vr/ParticleSplit/RussianRoulette = 2 "false" "true"

To set whether the region at each sub-component is symmetric or not and to define the corresponding split number::

    bv:Vr/ParticleSplit/Symmetric = 2 "false" "true"
    uv:Vr/ParticleSplit/SplitNumber = 2 8 8

In addition for this technique, geometrical Russian roulette will be played if a particle leaves the component or the world in a scheme similar to the :ref:`vr_importance_sampling` technique.
